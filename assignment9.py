""" Assignment 9 - Building an HDR image

This file has a number of functions that you need to fill out in order to
complete the assignment. Please write the appropriate code, following the
instructions on which functions you may or may not use.

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but the functions should NOT save the image to file. (This is a problem
    for us when grading because running 200 files results a lot of images being
    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Thanks.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we
    provide. You may not import anything else, you should be able to complete
    the assignment with the given libraries (and in most cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into
    classes, or your own infrastructure. This makes grading very difficult for
    us. Please only write code in the allotted region.

    Note: This sounds simple, but be very careful about getting this right. I
    heavily suggest you follow the steps listed below.

    1. Set 'out' equal to 'img' subtracted by the minimum of the image. For
    example, if your image range is from 10->20, subtracting the minimum will
    make the range from 0->10. The benefit of this is that if the range is from
    -10 to 10, it will set the range to be from 0->20. Since we will have to
    deal with negative values, it is important you normalize the function this
    way. We do the rounding for you so do not do any casting or rounding for
    the input values (a value like 163.92 will be cast to 163 by the return
    statement that casts everything to a uint8).

    2. Now, multiply 'out' by (255 / max) where max is the max value of 'out'.
    This max is computed after you subtract the minimum (not before).

    3. return 'out'.

def computeResponseCurve(intensity_samples, log_exposures, smoothing_lambda,
                         weighting_function, intensity_range=255):
    """ Find camera response curve for one color channel.

    The response curve is obtained by finding the least-squares solution
    to an overdetermined set of constraint equations (i.e., solve for x
    in Ax=b).

    The first step is to fill in mat_A and mat_b with the constraints
    described in section 2.1 of the research paper, "Recovering High Dynamic
    Range Radiance Maps from Photographs" by Debevec & Malik (available in
    the course resources materail on T-Square). We recommend that you break
    the process up into three steps: filling in data-fitting constraints,
    filling in smoothing constraints, and adding the color curve adjustment
    constraint. The steps required are described in detail below.

    PART 1: Constraints

        In this part, you will fill in mat_A and mat_b with values from the
        weighting function. Each row of mat_A is a constraint equation for
        the response curve.

        WHAT TO DO?
        1a. Data-Fitting Constraints

            Data-fitting constraints correspond to observed intensity values
            in the image stack - these constraints ensure that the response
            curve should correctly predicts the observed data.

            For each row i and column j in the intensity_samples array:

                i.   Set mat_A at the (idx_ctr, pixel_value) to the value
                     of the weighting function (wij)
                ii.  Set mat_A at the (idx_ctr, pix_range + i) to the
                     negative value of the weighting function (-wij)
                iii. Set mat_b at (idx_ctr, 0) to the product of the value
                     of the weighting function and the log of exposure j
                     (wij * log_exposure[j])

                     *  pixel_value is the value in intensity_samples at i, j
                     ** idx_ctr should start at zero, and should increase
                        by 1 each time the inner loop executes
                     *** wij is the value of the weighting function for the 
                         pixel intensity value at (i,j)  
                         (wij = weighting_function(intensity_samples[i, j])

        1b. Smoothing Constraints

            Smoothing constraints ensure that the response curve is smooth
            by restricting (penalizing) changes in the second derivative of
            the function. The constraints in this section are all equations
            that equal zero, so there is no need to set any values in mat_b.

            For each value idx in the range (1...intensity_range - 1):

                i.   Set mat_A at (offset + idx - 1, idx - 1) to the product
                     of the smoothing lambda parameter and the value of the
                     weighting function for idx.
                     (smoothing_lambda * weighting_function(idx))
                ii.  Set mat_A at (offset + idx - 1, idx) to -2 times the
                     product of the smoothing lambda parameter and the value
                     of the weighting function for idx.
                     (-2 * smoothing_lambda * weighting_function(idx))
                iii. Set mat_A at (offset + idx - 1, idx + 1) to the product
                     of the smoothing lambda parameter and the value of the
                     weighting function for idx.
                     (smoothing_lambda * weighting_function(idx))

        1c. Color curve constraint

            This constraint corresponds to the assumption that middle value
            pixels have unit exposure. This constraint is an equation that
            is equal to zero, so there is no need to set any values in mat_b.

            Set the value of mat_A in the last row and middle column
            (mat_A.shape[0], intensity_range / 2) to the constant 1.


    PART 2: Solving the system

        In this part we do some simple linear algebra. We are solving the
        function Ax=b. We want to solve for x. We have A and b.

        Ax = b.
        A^-1 * A * x = b.   (Note: the * multiply is the dot product here, but
                             in Python it performs an element-wise
                             multiplication so don't use it). What we want is
                             something like: my_mat.dot(other_mat)
        x = A^-1 * b.

        Pretty simple: x is the inverse of A dot b. Now, it gets a little bit
        more difficult because we can't obtain the inverse of a matrix that is
        not square (there are more constraint equations than unknown variables
        because the system is overdetermined). We can however use a different
        method to find the least-squares fit.

        This method is called the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse of a Matrix.

        WHAT TO DO?
        1a. Get the pseudoinverse of A. Numpy has an implementation of the
            Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse, so this is just a function call.

        1b. Multiply that psuedoinverse -- dot -- b. This becomes x. Make sure
            x is of the size 512 x 1.

    Note(1): For those of you unfamiliar with Python and getting to learn it
    this semester, this will have something "weird". weighting_function is not
    a value, but rather a function. This means we pass in the name of a
    function and then within the computeResponseCurve function you can use it
    to compute the weight (so you can do weighting_function(10) and it will
    return a value for the weight). Feel free to ask questions on Piazza if
    the concept doesn't click in.

    1. Sample pixel intensities from random locations through the image stack
    2. Compute response curves (Note: We pass in the weight function here)
    3. Build image radiance map from response curves.
    4. Apply tone mapping to fit the high dynamic range values into a limited
       range for a specific print or display medium (Note: we don't do this
       part - but you're free to experiment.)
